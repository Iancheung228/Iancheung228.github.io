## Introduction
Batch norm is a mechanism that aims to stabilize the distribution of inputs to a network layer during training. Neural networks with BatchNorm tend to train faster and are less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, they convert the first two moments to mean 0 and variance one.


## what is batch norm
$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$


$$ \hat{y} = \gamma \frac{(y - \hat{\mu})}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 + \varepsilon}} + \beta $$

#### Cauchy's Theorem

Let $U$ be an open subset of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, and suppose the closed
disk $D$ defined as

$$
D = \{z:|z-z_{0}|\leq r\}
$$

is completely contained in $U$. Let $f: U\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function,
and let $\gamma$ be the circle, oriented counterclockwise, forming the boundary of
$D$. Then for every $a$ in the interior of $D$,

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz.
$$
